## jDrupal...

- solves many common development needs for Drupal based applications.
- provides a familiar Drupal coding experience and syntax for developers.
- runs alongside any frontend client side framework, or with no framework at all.

Since jDrupal has no dependencies and is written in pure JavaScript, it can be used in a wide variety of architectures and frameworks. Just include it in the `<head>` of your app's `index.html` file:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... -->
    <script src="jdrupal.min.js"></script>
    <!-- ... -->
  </head>
  <body><!-- ... --></body>
</html>
```
